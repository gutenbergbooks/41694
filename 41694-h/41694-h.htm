<h3>PLATE I.&mdash;A SHIP AGROUND.</h3>

<p class="center small">From the oil painting
by Turner in the Tate Gallery. (Frontispiece)</p>

<p>This beautiful sea piece is essentially Turner&mdash;the result of his
personal observation. It was painted after he had freed himself
from the desire to rival and outvie his predecessors, and before
he became obsessed by the passion to paint pure sunlight. "A
Ship Aground" is a pendant to "The Old Chain Pier, Brighton,"
which also hangs in the Tate Gallery.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_I" id="LETTER_I">LETTER I</a><br />
<span class="subheading">EXPLANATORY</span></h2>


<p>Yes: I remember that morning at Exeter
when I surprised you making a drawing
of the west porch of the cathedral. Timidly
were the unrestored figures of angels, apostles,
prophets, kings and warriors&mdash;very old, very
battered&mdash;taking form in your sketch-book:<span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
timidly, for even then you were beginning to
be troubled by the blur that rose, after an
hour's work, between your eyes and the carven
kings and saints.</p>

<p>Your sister passed into the cathedral to her
devotions carrying white flowers for the altar:
we stayed in the sunlight. I cannot remember
how Turner became the subject of our talk;
but I think it was my mention of his drawing
of the west front of Salisbury Cathedral done
when he was twenty-three&mdash;one of the set exhibited
at the Royal Academy in 1799, which
hastened his election to an Associateship of
the Royal Academy. Those were the days of
the tinted architectural drawings, but in that
magnificent Salisbury, the details indicated, yet
not insistent, the old stones yellow in the sunshine,
grey-blue in the shadow, Turner was
already on the track of Light, the goal of
his art life. He had not yet formulated any
principle, that was not Turner's way; but those
small, bright eyes of his had already perceived
that there is light in shade as in shine. Girtin,
that marvellous boy, his friend and fellow-student,
was still alive; but art was in a poor<span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
state in England, in 1799, and we can well
believe that this drawing of Salisbury made
Turner a marked man. I could dispense with
the lamp-post boys playing with hoops, as indeed
with every figure in every picture by Turner.
But he needed such strong foreground notes,
and he, like the older landscape painters, troubled
little about figures. Claude used to say, with a
laugh, that he made no charge for them. Their
use was to throw back the middle distance.</p>

<div class="caption">
<h3>PLATE II.&mdash;HASTINGS.</h3>

<p class="small center">(From the oil painting
by Turner in the Tate Gallery)</p>

<p>One of the so-called "unfinished" pictures that, after half a
century of seclusion in the cellars of the National Gallery, were
removed to the Tate Gallery, and opened to public inspection
early in February 1906. This great "find," as it was called, of
twenty-one Turners was the sensation of the year in art circles.
Hastings was a favourite subject with Turner.</p>
</div>

<p>Then we talked of Turner's water-colours.
Had he never composed the "Liber Studiorum";
never produced gorgeous dreams of glowing
colour in his oil pictures; never with veils of
luminous paint flashed sunrise upon white canvases;
never done a moonlight, or white sails
billowing over a wet sea, he would, in his water-colours,
have earned the title of father of modern
landscape and of Impressionism.</p>

<p>You, who had seen nothing of Turner's work
except the plates, good in their way, but far
from being the real thing, in Mr. Stopford
Brooke's edition of the "Liber Studiorum," hinted
that you found the master old-fashioned. Corot,
Monet, and Harpignies were your idols in land<span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span>scape.
That was not strange when I consider
that your childhood was spent in Jersey, and
your youth at Moret and in Paris, and that on
your twentieth birthday, a few months ago, you
were articled to an architect of Exeter, your
France-loving father's native place. So the
Master seemed old-fashioned, did he? And you
were a little sceptical of my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Ah," I said, "if you could see a range of
Turner's water-colours from the first boyish
drawing of Lambeth Palace exhibited at the
Royal Academy when he was fifteen, through
the plodding period of his development, cumbered
with ungainly figures, but set in the
Turnerian air and against infinite distances, as
in the winding Thames from Richmond Hill,
ever moving towards the light, on to his later
visions when buildings, hills, and clouds shimmer
in iridescent vapour! Then the figures of men
and women disappear, and after fifty years of
observation of Nature those old eyes see only
the chromatic glories of the reflections and refractions
of imponderable sun-rays. The lovely
colours linger so delicately on odds and ends of
paper that it seems as if a breath must blow<span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span>
them away. If you could see the sapphire, opal
and amethyst tenderness of his 'Study on the
Rhine,' the misty hills rainbow-tinted, the sun
flushing the steep castle rock and making a
golden pathway over the sea, you would feel that
this barber's son, morose, mean, in whose muddled
brain moved until his last day magnificent ideas,
has given to the world the whole history of water-colour,
from the tinted drawing, to the flame of an
effect seen and caught in a moment of ecstasy."</p>

<p>You were still sceptical! I acknowledge that
there were others in Turner's day who also
broke new paths&mdash;Cozens, and of course Girtin,
of whom Turner is reported to have said, "Had
Tom Girtin lived I should have starved." As
an old man he would mumble of "Poor Tom's
golden drawings." I acknowledge that since
Turner's day the channel that he flooded has
broadened and gushed forth into many tributaries;
but he was the first, modelling himself
on Claude, to start in pursuit of the sun, to break
the rays, and flush the land.</p>

<p>I quoted a Frenchman, M. le Sizeranne: "All
the torches which have shed a flood of new
light upon Art&mdash;that of Delacroix in 1825, those<span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span>
of the Impressionists in 1870&mdash;have in turn been
lit at his flame."</p>

<p>I quoted Constable&mdash;generous Constable&mdash;"I
believe it would be difficult to say that there is
a bit of landscape now done that does not
emanate from that source."</p>

<p>I quoted Pisarro, telling how during the war
of 1870 he and Monet came to London, studied
Turner at the National Gallery, and found in
Turner and Constable "practical certitude in
matters of technique which they had but vaguely
suspected and discussed at the Café Guerbois."
What would they have said had they known
that Ruskin, the champion of Turner, the foe
of Impressionism, when, in 1856, he sifted the
nineteen thousand Turner water-colours, drawings,
studies, and the "unfinished" paintings,
had condemned the sunshine and atmosphere
canvases now in the Tate Gallery to half a
century of obscurity, because in his opinion they
were "unfinished." Turner purposely left them
unfinished and elusive as sunrise itself, momentary
impressions of the glory of the world. The
sun is new each day, ever uncompleted: so are
these records of the flame of Turner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>"They are golden visions," said Constable,
speaking of the Venice pictures, "only visions,
but still one would like to live and die with such
pictures."</p>

<p>Turner, to whom the world of men and
women was a place to escape from, brooded
on scenes that open a pathway to tired eyes
leading away somewhere west of the sun and
east of the moon; he loved distances, lakes that
feel their way round hills to infinity, and sunsets
that are a world in themselves. Even in
his dark "Calais Pier" he must open the inky
clouds to a blue sky swaying above the bituminous
sea. In the "unfinished" "Chichester
Canal" you may sail over that happy waterway,
beyond the spire, on and on whithersoever your
fancy leads; in the "unfinished" "Petworth
Park" you may tramp away with the hunter
and the hounds past the sentinel trees to that
vast sky flaming and beckoning; in the "unfinished"
"<a href="#PLATE_III">Norham Castle Sunrise</a>" the poet-artist
dreamed the mystery of dawn, and as he
saw the miracle unfolding, he told his dream to
you and to me; he saw the blue mists parting
before the sun-rays rising behind the castle;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
saw the opalescent sky reflected in the water;
saw, perhaps, in the mind's eye, the strong red
note that the picture needed, and quickly set
that cow standing knee-deep in the shallows.
Turner gave all of himself to the making of this
lovely impression, for Norham Castle, which he
drew and painted so often, was his mascot.
Sketching on the Tweed with Cadell, the Edinburgh
bookseller, as they passed Norham Castle,
Turner suddenly swept off his hat to the ruins.
"I made a drawing of Norham several years
ago," he explained. "It took; and from that
day to this I have had as much to do as my
hands could execute."</p>

<p>There, I remember, I paused, noting that you
were again passing your hands about your eyes.
Troubled, you said that the blur had returned,
and that you must work no more that day. So
we walked towards the river.</p>

<p>On the way we saw Italian workmen in blue
trousers paving a road from cauldrons of molten
asphalt. We watched the little flames leaping
from the bubbling mass, and I drew from the
sight an image of the art life of Turner: how he
stoked his furnace with Poussin, Vandevelde,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 21]</span>
and de Loutherbourg, and so brought to life his
dark early works such as "The Shipwreck" and
"Calais Pier"; how as he fed his fire with
Claude, Crome, and Wilson the furnace glowed,
and the world saw the ardour of "Ulysses Deriding
Polyphemus," and the splendour of "Dido
Building Carthage"; then when the flames leapt
towards the sky there was pure Turner, the
Turner of the "<a href="#PLATE_IV">Téméraire</a>" and the <a href="#PLATE_V">Venice</a>
dreams, a "<a href="#PLATE_II">Hastings</a>" that has lost all earthly
form; a dream boat passing between Headlands
at Sunrise, and the later water-colours&mdash;the red
Rigi, the blue Rigi, the blue and gold "<a href="#PLATE_VI">Arth
from the Lake of Zug</a>," the moonlight Venice,
and the atmospheric magic of the Lake of Uri.</p>

<p>When we regained the Cathedral close we
met your sister returning from her devotions.
She said: "What have you been discussing
this summer morning?"</p>

<p>"I have been discoursing on The Flame of
Turner," said I.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said she, "there's a Turner in the
Museum here."</p>

<p>We went to the Museum and stood before
"Buttermere Lake, with a part of Cromach<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
Water, Cumberland&mdash;a Shower." You were
silent. What a catastrophe&mdash;after my dithyrambs
about the flame of Turner and his slow
soar to light, that I should show you, as your
first Turner, that work of his early stoking
period, painted at twenty-two, before he learned
the method of oil painting and the ways of the
sun. The lake has almost gone, the trees have
blackened, only the rainbow dimly lingers. The
flame of Turner? The chrysalis husk of Turner!</p>

<p>That poor "Buttermere Lake" is still the
only picture by Turner that you have ever seen.
And now that you are far from here, walking
and digging in Sparta, and sailing in insecure
little crafts to the Islands, I hold it a duty to
write you in detachments this interminable letter
explaining as well as I can what I mean by the
Flame of Turner. Your sister will read the
letters to you, ill-starred student, who, at the
beginning of your art career, must not use your
eyes for twelve months on penalty of blindness.</p>

<p>When, after the last visit to the oculist, you
hurried from the lawyer's office in Lincoln's Inn
Fields, where I witnessed your Will, I did not
tell you that a few yards away rests a glorious<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
Turner, "Van Tromp's Barge entering the
Texel" and sailing in golden pomp eternally
through the Soane Museum. I saw it on my
way to your lawyer's office. The picture is
alone and I was alone with what Turner loved&mdash;a
sportive sea, an arching sky, gold overhead,
gold on the water, and a ship sailing home
golden-hulled beneath golden sails, with flags
flying at the mast, and a cunning wraith of
indigo cloud sweeping down the sky to give the
glamour value. You did not see the golden Van
Tromp. I had not the heart to show it to you.</p>

<h3>PLATE III.&mdash;NORHAM CASTLE.</h3>

<p class="small center">(From the
oil painting by Turner in the Tate Gallery)</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful of the impressionistic Turners that
were removed from the cellars of the National Gallery early in
1906, cleaned, and hung in the Turner Room at Millbank. Once,
when passing Norham Castle, Turner took off his hat to the
ruins. His companion inquired the reason. "I made a drawing
or painting of Norham Castle several years since," answered
Turner. "It took; and from that day to this I have had as
much to do as my hands could execute."</p>
</div>

<p>Now you are far from Turner. I can follow
your track to Olympia, and along the path by
the wood, above the excavations, to a rough
sign-post, where I stood two years ago and read
the words "To Arcadia!" Somewhere beyond
Arcadia you are, and some day these letters will
fall, one by one, into your hands.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_II" id="LETTER_II">LETTER II</a><br />
<span class="subheading">HIS LIFE: AN IMPRESSION</span></h2>


<p>Once in our walk from Exeter Cathedral
to the river you paused and asked what
kind of a man was this amalgam of poet-artist
and suspicious tradesman. And I, who had been
so long studying his works, and dipping into the
lives of him by Thornbury, Hamerton, Cosmo
Monkhouse, Sir Walter Armstrong, Mr. W. L.
Wyllie, and others, tried to give an impression
of the man Turner&mdash;a blur of his sayings, letters,
habits, and the comments of his biographers.
Some of them have bewailed that his was not
a pattern life, such as would edify a Y.M.C.A.
audience. Nature produces such useful lives
by the hundred thousand: she makes but one
Turner. The Church had blessed neither his
union with Mrs. Danby, nor with Mrs. Booth,
and, in his later days, he preferred rum and
water with sea-faring men in Wapping or<span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span>
Rotherhithe to dreary dinner-parties in dreary
houses in the West End of London, which does
not seem to me strange. We must take him as
he was and be grateful. It was Nature's whim
to link this great artist-soul to the starved soul
of a petty tradesman. As an artist he is with
the immortals: as a man he was true son of the
covetous, kindly barber of Maiden Lane, Strand,
keen on halfpennies, a driver of hard bargains.
The father haggled with his customers, the son
with engravers and picture buyers. Secretive,
suspicious, ambitious, sometimes mean, yet
capable of great kindnesses and sacrifices, was
this little hook-nosed man in an ill-cut brown
coat, and enormous frilled shirt, with feet and
hands notably small. Kind? Yes. Did he
not in the Academy of 1826 cover his glowing
picture of "Cologne&mdash;The Arrival of a Packet
Boat&mdash;Evening" with a wash of lamp-black,
because it "killed" two portraits by Sir Thomas
Lawrence hanging alongside. "Poor Lawrence
was so unhappy," said Turner. "The lamp-black
will all wash off after the Exhibition."
But Turner's moods were capricious. Like all
blessed or cursed with the artistic temperament,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
the mood of the moment usually governed his
actions. Six years after the lamp-black incident
he had a grey picture hanging beside Constable's
"Opening of Waterloo Bridge," and Turner
(you may imagine the fury in his bright eyes)
watched his brother artist heightening with vermilion
and lake the decorations and flags of his
City barges. Presently, when Constable had
gone away, Turner put a round daub of red
lead upon his grey picture, which he afterwards
shaped into a buoy. Constable said when he
returned, "Turner has been here and fired a
gun." Turner liked a joke, and if it was sometimes
at the expense of another, that was but
the way of his class.</p>

<p>From first to last he loved but one thing with
heart and soul&mdash;his art. His affection for his
father, and for Mr. Fawkes of Farnley Hall,
were but interludes in his passion to interpret
Nature, to make her conform to his visions, and
to excel his predecessors and contemporaries.
Certainly, in his way, he loved his "old dad,"
who lived with him until his death, looking after
the picture gallery of unsold works in Queen
Anne Street, and helping in the preparation of<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
his canvases. Of his father he was wont to
chuckle, "Dad taught me nothing except to save
halfpence." The death of the old man was a
great blow.</p>

<p>The love affair which Thornbury relates
amounts to nothing&mdash;no human thing ever really
interfered with his art. His schooling at Brentford
and Margate was infinitesimal&mdash;but for a
landscape and sea painter, what education could
have been better than the river and the boats at
Brentford and the sea and ships at Margate.
He remained illiterate to the end. When he
wrote a description of St. Michael's Mount for
the publication called "Coast Scenery," Coombes
complained that "Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;'s account is the most
extraordinary composition I have ever read; in
parts it is absolutely unintelligible." As Professor
of Perspective at the Royal Academy he
was unable to express his ideas, but, says
Thornbury, "he took great pains to prepare
the most learned diagrams."</p>

<p>Throughout his life he extended and amended
that amazing poem called "Fallacies of Hope,"
portions of which he tagged to his pictures in
the Royal Academy Catalogue. It is doggerel<span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
with occasional glints of the beauty, pomp, and
wonder of the world that showered when he
used his rightful methods of self-expression&mdash;eye
and hand. The romance of the ancient world of
myth and architecture tingled in this secretive,
slovenly, Jewy man; but when he essayed to
learn Greek, in the happy days at Sandycombe,
the attempt had to be abandoned. The slow
brain could not master the verbs.</p>

<p>Ambition was strong within him. No toil
was too long or too severe. He travelled England
and Europe, sketched everything, stored
the forms of buildings and effects of light and
colour; and could recall what he had garnered
at an instant's notice. In painting he pitted
himself against the dead, against his contemporaries,
against twenty miles of country, against
the very glory of the sun, wrestling with each
in turn, and chuckling as they succumbed.</p>

<p>He saved his money and in later years
hoarded his pictures. He refused to pass potential
purchasers to his studio, but Gillott, the pen-maker,
bearded the lion in Queen Anne Street,
pushed past Mrs. Danby, joked with the old
man when he growled, "Don't want to sell!"<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
and carried off in his cab some five thousand
pounds worth of pictures.</p>

<p>Turner re-bought his canvases when they
came up for sale at Christie's, worked without
cessation, practised all manner of petty economies,
and finally left his pictures to the nation
and his fortune of one hundred and forty
thousand pounds to found a home for "decayed
male artists of English parents and of lawful
issue, with an instruction for a Turner medal
at the Royal Academy, and a monument to
himself in St. Paul's Cathedral."</p>

<p>The will with its four codicils was a bewildering
document. For years it was wrangled over
in the courts, and in the end a compromise was
effected. The fortune went to the next of kin,
the pictures and drawings to the nation, and
twenty thousand pounds to the Royal Academy.
Ruskin summed up the compromise thus: "The
nation buried, with threefold honour, Turner's
body in St. Paul's, his pictures at Charing Cross,
and his purposes in Chancery."</p>

<p>If Turner, as he eyes the landscape of the
Elysian Fields, retains aught of earth-life frailty,
he must look angrily down upon the Turner<span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span>
section of the National Gallery, upon the rooms
beneath, reached by a winding staircase, where
some of his water-colours are crowded, upon the
sunlight canvases at the Tate Gallery; and at
certain provincial exhibitions whither some of
his works have overflowed from the National
Gallery. For he stated explicitly in his will that
the pictures should be kept together in a room
or rooms to be added to the National Gallery, to
be called Turner's Gallery, and to be built within
ten years of his demise.</p>

<p>I still hope that the Turner Gallery may be
built. Perhaps the hope will become a reality.
What a sight Turner's pictures chronologically
arranged would be, from the dim experimental
pieces and the "Moonlight: A Study at Millbank,"
to those four works, splendid failures, now
at the Tate Gallery, that he painted the year
before he died, when the mind of the old man,
having flamed from the embers to express the
opalescent loveliness of Venice, the grey tumult
of the sea in the Whaling series, the glory of the
sun flashed in stains of luminous colour upon
white canvases, harked back, in the shadow of
death, to the old legends he had always loved,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
and painted them as of yore, but now blurred
and tumbling, mighty ruins rising from blue
lakes by great rivers and arching pines, with
an impossible Æneas relating his story to an
unrealised Dido, or being admonished by a
Noah's-Ark Mercury. The imagination remains
gorgeous if chaotic; at seventy-five he still
reaches towards the unattainable, still seeks in
visions a way of escape from the materialism and
stupidity of the world.</p>

<h3>PLATE IV.&mdash;THE FIGHTING TÉMÉRAIRE.</h3>

<p class="small center">(From the oil painting by Turner in the National Gallery)</p>

<p>Exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1839. In the previous year
a party of friends, including Turner, were bound for Greenwich
by water. They passed a steam-tug towing a superannuated
battleship. "That's a fine subject for you, Turner." said Stanfield.
The painter took the hint, and produced "The Fighting
Téméraire tugged to her last Berth to be broken up."</p>
</div>

<p>What a triumph to see the range of oil
pictures with the water-colours stepping daintily
through the stages of his development to those
latter dreams of the Rhine and Swiss lakes, fairy
scenes that live, as by a miracle, on pieces of
mere paper; also the proofs of the "Liber," with
Mr. Frank Short's interpretations of the drawings
that were never engraved, bringing the
number up to a round hundred; also the tall
books, one cold, beautiful steel engraving on a
page, such as "Château Gaillard" in the volume
called "Turner's Annual Tour, 1834," a view which
charms the eyes dulled by grey London and
makes the feet impatient to be off to Richard
Coeur-de-Lion's castle on the bend of the Seine.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
The portraits, sketches and caricatures, too, of
Turner of Maiden Lane, Hand's Court, Hammersmith,
Twickenham, Queen Anne and Harley
Streets, Chelsea, and of all the world&mdash;they
should hang near his life-work.</p>

<p>You will see him, when the good time of the
Turner Gallery comes, as a pretty youth, painted
by himself, no doubt a flattering likeness, which
hangs in the National Gallery. It is a bust
portrait, full-face, with large estimating eyes,
somewhat amazed, a heavy nose, and a dropping
under-lip. An attractive boy; but you must
remember that Turner the idealist painted it,
and that he had worked for a time in the studio
of Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p>

<p>Nearer to the Turner that one visualises is
the sturdy middle-aged man seated under a tree,
cross-legged, pencil in hand, in the painting by
Charles Turner. The brickdust face is clean-shaven,
the nose unmistakably Semitic; the
hair is long, and the whiskers straggle to the
collar. A drawing rests upon his knee; he
looks forth with an eye like a sword, considering
how he shall change the landscape. The sketch
by Maclise is a delight. Turner sits on a stool<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
up in the clouds, painting; the tail of his coat
flaps over towards the earth, his boot is crooked
into the support of the easel, and beneath him
rises the sun with the word "Turner" blazoned
amid the rays. But the best of the series,
because it has that touch of caricature which
often approaches nearer to life than a reasoned
drawing, is the portrait by William Parrott made
on Varnishing Day at the Royal Academy in 1846,
when he was seventy-one. Turner is painting
furiously upon his picture. The frame stands on
the floor. The top is but an inch shorter than
the battered beaver hat crushed over upon his
big head. His Mrs. Gamp umbrella leans against
a chair. His fellow-Academicians stare at his
picture and at his colour-box, puzzled. "How
does he do it?" they whisper.</p>

<p>In those days the members of the Academy
were allowed four varnishing days. In his latter
years Turner would send his pictures merely
laid in with white and grey and complete them
on the varnishing days. There was brown sherry
at luncheon, and Wilkie Collins describes the
old man as "sitting on the top of a flight of
steps, or a box, like a shabby Bacchus nodding<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
at his picture." But he could paint a "Rain,
Steam, and Speed" and "The Sun of Venice
going to Sea" in spite of the brown sherry, and
his lonely bachelor life.</p>

<p>But brown sherry or no brown sherry, to his
dying day he never lost interest in the love of his
life, light. At seventy years of age, when he is
described as stooping, looking down and muttering
to himself, he would pump Brewster as to all
he knew on the subject of light. Those were
the days of the infancy of photography, and Mr.
Mayall, who was experimenting with daguerreotypes,
tells how the old man, whose eyes were
then weak and bloodshot, would sit in his studio
day after day asking questions. He pretended
that he was a Master in Chancery.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III">LETTER III</a><br />
<span class="subheading">HIS ART: THE FURNACE DOORS OPEN</span></h2>


<p>There is a small, neglected room in the
National Gallery where certain beginnings
and failures in art are entombed. If you were to
stroll into that sepulchre on a dark day, I fear
you would exclaim that "Buttermere Lake" is
bright compared with those other early Turners
"Morning on Coniston Fells" and "Moonlight:
a Study at Millbank." Even on early March
afternoons, when the sun strikes through the tall
windows and falls upon "Moonlight at Millbank,"
little is visible on the small, sooty canvas except
the full moon, looking like a discoloured white
wafer stuck upon the dim sky. Turner developed
slowly. This veritable nocturne, and the pictures
that followed it shows how slow and difficult was
his mastery of oil as a medium.</p>

<p>In the early nineteenth century Claude, the
Poussins, Salvator Rosa, and Cuyp were the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 42]</span>
idols of landscape art, which was still regarded
as a sort of interloper in the realm swayed by
religious and mythological pictures, portraits,
genre works, and "Dutch drolleries." The
academic pioneers in landscape had imposed
themselves upon Nature and upon the English
gentry who were the patrons of art. Landscape
might be classically beautiful according
to Claude, classically sublime according to
Salvator, homely and mildly sunny according
to Cuyp, conventionally maritime according to
Vandevelde. Turner as a youth was not the
man to break tradition. The cunning tradesman
in him preferred the well-beaten path. It was
his destiny to compete against the popular idols
in turn, to sweep past them to Nature herself,
and so onwards and upwards to the sun, the
source of all light and colour. "Looked on the
sun with hope" is one of the few simple and
suggestive lines in his "Fallacies of Hope."</p>

<p>Averse in his beginnings, like Velazquez, to
experimentalising, he was content to bide his
time, to plough the furrows of other men, with
the indwelling determination to plough them
better. He admired with generosity; he never<span class="pagenum">[Pg 43]</span>
depreciated. "Vandevelde made me a painter,"
he said, years later, and of a golden-brown Cuyp
he exclaimed, "I would give a thousand pounds
to have painted that."</p>

<p>If ever, exiled student, we visit the National
Gallery together on the Turner quest, I shall
take you first to that room where, from the
grave, he challenges Claude of Lorraine. Turner
bequeathed "The Sun Rising in a Mist," painted
when he was thirty-two, and "Dido Building
Carthage," painted when he was forty, to the
nation, on condition that they should hang for
ever "between the two pictures painted by
Claude, the 'Seaport' and the 'Mill.'" There
you have a glimpse into the mind of Turner, his
fine envy of others, his confidence in his own
power. A Frenchman, M. Viardot, incensed at
the idea that any one should approach the throne
of the Lorrainer, suggests that such o'ervaulting
pride was a proof of Turner's insanity. I will
not answer such foolishness, but British candour
compels me to say that I do not think Claude
suffers by the comparison. Turner became great
when he became himself, not when he was trying
to outvie others&mdash;Titian, Morland, Gainsborough,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 44]</span>
Crome&mdash;to name but four. In the year that he
painted "The Sun Rising in a Mist" he was
trying in his "Country Blacksmith" to trip
Wilkie, and in "The Sun Rising in a Mist," as
Mr. Wyllie shows, the figures are taken almost
exactly from Teniers, and the snub-nosed, high-pooped
ships from Vandevelde. His time was
not yet. He was learning furiously, brooding
upon and correlating his impressions of Nature,
storing them for future use, shredding the permanent
from the trivial. I think of him on that
tossing trip to Bur Island in a half-decked boat
with Cyrus Redding, silently watching the sea,
absorbed in contemplation, climbing to the
summit of the island in a hurricane of wind,
where he "seemed writing rather than drawing."
Not yet could he say to a companion, looking at
a black cow against the sun, "It's purple, not
black as it is painted"; not yet had the sun
begun to flood his drawings; not yet were the
"brown tree school" angry because forms lost
their details in the blinding light of his pictures.
But in "Dido building Carthage," painted in
1815, the same year as the popular "Crossing
the Brook," of which he thought so highly that<span class="pagenum">[Pg 45]</span>
he talked in his ironic, humorous way of being
wrapped up in it as a winding-sheet, there are
signs that he was feeling the fascination of
colour.</p>

<p>Some day you will stand at the entrance of
the great Turner Room in the National Gallery
and rest your eyes on the six huge dark pictures
on the left wall. The dull and uninspiring
"Waterloo" is later than the others; but to me
it is just as unattractive as its companions&mdash;as I
think it will be, light lover, to you. "The Tenth
Plague" and "The Deluge" I never look at
except when I wish to be reminded that from
the chrysalis rises the butterfly, from the black
furnace the loveliness of the flame. The "Death
of Nelson" is dark and decorative, "Calais Pier"
and "The Shipwreck" are dark and tremendous.
"Nobody is wet," said Ruskin, and nobody feels
that he is looking on the real Calais, or on a real
shipwreck, yet what power they have. These
funereal wild waves were made in Harley
Street; light, to the slow-developing Turner,
was still a studio convention. But nobody
else could have made those seas. They are
by Turner, but not by the true Turner, who<span class="pagenum">[Pg 46]</span>
strove through the veiled sun to the source of
light itself.</p>

<p>In "Crossing the Brook," which faces the entrance
doorway, painted when he was forty,
Turner has marched onward. The gates have
opened to the far horizon, and he now gives us
the Turnerian fifty miles or so of country outstretching
to infinity on a few feet of canvas. If
you were with me, I would whisper in your ear
my division of "Crossing the Brook" into pleasing
and unpleasing passages&mdash;the pleasing being
the fleecy clouds in the blue sky, the faint miles
of Devonshire, the wooded hills rising from the
river, and the bridge that spans the water: the
unpleasing passages are the worried foreground,
the ugly rocks, the figures, and the black mouth
of the tunnel. Yet it is a picture of which one
becomes fond. Who can but be entranced by the
distance, Turner's sign mark, the open gate that
lures us away from the troubled foreground of
the world.</p>

<p>I turn from the sanity of "Crossing the Brook"
to the right wall, and straightway I am elated, it
is always so, at the sight of one of the magnificent
dreams that the old Wizard forced oil<span class="pagenum">[Pg 47]</span>
paint and brushes to portray. In the centre of
the wall hangs "Ulysses and Polyphemus."</p>

<p>The furnace doors are open, from them stream
a fury of glow, and in the fire are the dazzling
shapes of Turnerian romance.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_IV" id="LETTER_IV">LETTER IV</a><br />
<span class="subheading">THE FLAME ASCENDS</span></h2>


<p>When we visit the National Gallery I will
place you with your back to the dark
"Calais Pier" and "Shipwreck" wall, and
waving my hand across to that glorious trio,
the "Ulysses," the "Bay of Baiæ," and the
"Carthage," I will say but one word&mdash;"Turner!"</p>

<p>Here indeed is the magician weaving his
spells, breaking the laws of light and shade, toying
with history, caring nothing so long as he
can picture the dreams of the pomp and beauty
of the world of imagination that dazzled a sullen
man, pottering about in a dingy London studio.
"Ulysses deriding Polyphemus" has been called
operatic and melodramatic; it has been remarked
that the galley of Ulysses, far from the influence
of the sun, is in full light, and that the dark
shadows thrown by the stone-pines in the "Bay
of Baiæ" are unnatural. Turner needed those<span class="pagenum">[Pg 51]</span>
deep blacks in the foreground; he wanted the
galley of Ulysses to be in the light: so the old
rascal forced truth to suit his vision. His success
is his expiation. He never copied Nature or
followed history. His way was to use Nature
and history to suit his conception, the right
way for a genius; but not for Brown, Smith,
and Jones. Anachronisms abound in his works;
he elongated steeples, rebuilt towers and towns,
changed the courses of rivers (he in paint, as
Leonardo with the pencil); but he caught the
spirit of place. To me the "Ulysses deriding
Polyphemus" is the very heart of romance. Unlike
life, yes; all the best things are unlike life.
I withdraw my remark that there is not a figure
in a picture by Turner which I would not rather
have erased, withdraw it in favour of the vast,
impotent Polyphemus writhing on the cliff. When
Turner painted the figures of gods and goddesses
in the likeness of men and women he was bored;
when he painted a giant monster like this Polyphemus
his imagination inspired him. Asked
where he found his subject, he invented two silly
lines of doggerel and said they came from Tom
Dibdin. His lonely visions were not for the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 52]</span>
chatter of a dinner party. They may be tracked
in that little red book found by Thornbury in his
studio, where, amid notes about chemistry, memoranda
as to colours, and prophylactics against
the Maltese plague, are certain scraps of verse,
something about, "Anna's kiss," "a look back,"
"a toilsome dream," "human joy, ecstasy, and
hope."</p>

<h3>PLATE VI.&mdash;ARTH FROM THE LAKE OF ZUG.</h3>

<p class="small center">(From the water-colour by Turner in the National Gallery)</p>

<p>"Elaborate and lovely," wrote Ruskin. "We sleep at Arth,
and are up, and out on the lake, early in the morning; to good
purpose. The sun rises behind the Mythens, and we see such
an effect of lake and light, as we shall not forget soon."</p>
</div>

<p>Here I pause to ask myself how I can possibly
give you, who have never seen it, an idea of the
Turner room at the National Gallery. I close
my eyes and visualise the route. I ascend the
stairs, and am detained by two Turners that
have, against his will, overflowed into an outer
room&mdash;the beautiful heat-hazy Abingdon, and
distant London, seen from Greenwich. Almost
reluctantly I walk into the large gallery, and
pass from the glorious sunrise in Ulysses to the
glorious sunset in "<a href="#PLATE_IV">The Fighting Téméraire</a>,"
painted just ten years later. Claude and the
others have been left far behind. Here is Turner
the visionary, alone with the sun and the sea, untroubled
by the necessity of painting the puny
figure of man, but glorying in the symbols of
man's power, the new tug dragging the stately<span class="pagenum">[Pg 53]</span>
old battleship to her last berth, a theme near to
his heart&mdash;the end of a period in man's history
flickering out in the ageless glory of Nature.</p>

<p>Pages, chapters, have been written about the
untruth of this picture. "His light and shade,"
says Mr. Wyllie, "is very seldom correct. His
tones are almost always wrong. The place
where the sun is setting in the '<a href="#PLATE_IV">Téméraire</a>' is the
darkest part of the picture." But what does it
matter? This is his vision, of the absolute end of
man's work in this daily death of Nature. Who
would have one inch changed? About this, as
about almost all the pictures, there is a story.
The Téméraire "killed" a portrait by Geddes
hanging above it, whereupon Geddes began to
lay in a vivid Turkey carpet on his canvas.
"Ho! ho!" cried Turner, who loved a fight; and
the unfortunate Geddes watched him loading on
orange, scarlet, and yellow with his palette knife.</p>

<p>I close my eyes to the splendour of the
"<a href="#PLATE_IV">Téméraire</a>" and see "The Burial of Wilkie,"
a silvery blue sky and sea shimmering with
delicate reflections, the mourning, black-sailed
vessel severed by the flare of the torches, their
brilliancy and the black of the sails forming vast<span class="pagenum">[Pg 54]</span>
tracks of light and gloom on the water. On
Varnishing Day Stanfield urged that the sails
were untrue. Turner grunted&mdash;"Wish I had
any colour to make 'em blacker."</p>

<p>Then I see the "Snowstorm&mdash;Steamboat off
a Harbour's Mouth making Signals in Shallow
Water and going by the lead," which <i>Punch</i>
called "A Typhoon bursting in a Simoon over
the Whirlpool of Maelstrom, Norway, with a
ship on fire, an eclipse, and the effect of a lunar
rainbow." Turner is now sixty-seven. He is
prepared to push paint to its ultimate limit so
that he can achieve the impossible. To study
the effect of this hubbub of snowstorm and gale
he put to sea in the tempest, and made the sailors
lash him to the mast for four hours. It was the
hostile reception of this picture following the
attacks on others in previous years, the jeers of
<i>Punch</i>, the shafts of <i>Blackwood</i>, that inspired
Ruskin to compose "Modern Painters." The
first volume was published the following year,
1843, but that colossal work had its beginnings
in a letter Ruskin wrote in 1836 defending
Turner's picture of Venice called "Juliet and
her Nurse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>Turner was famous long before "Modern
Painters" was published, and although that
pæan of appreciation has carried his fame to
the ends of the English-speaking world, the
riot of its praise has tipped the pens of some
critics with gall. The "Slave Ship" exalted so
eloquently by Ruskin, and now in Boston, was
described by George Inness, the American artist,
as "the most infernal piece of clap-trap ever
painted."</p>

<p>The aged Turner suffered from the criticisms
of the "Snowstorm." Ruskin tells how he heard
the old man one evening muttering to himself
"Soapsuds and Whitewash." On the "Graduate
of Oxford" attempting to soothe him, he burst
out&mdash;"What would they have? I wonder what
they think the sea's like? I wish they'd been
in it!"</p>

<p>Beneath the "Snowstorm" at the National
Gallery hang two pictures, shining with a radiance
not of the earth, "The Sun of Venice going
to Sea," and "The Approach to Venice," wrecks
perhaps of what they were, but still lovely, in one
all the pomp of Venice, in the other all her haunting
and elusive beauty. A little further along the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 56]</span>
wall in the direction of the "Ulysses" is the parent
picture of Impressionism, that incomparable presentment
of movement, mist, and moisture, aptly
named "Rain, Steam, and Speed." The fools
called this a phantom picture, complained that
the locomotive has not the appearance of metal.
Turner was not painting the fact of an engine;
but the effect of an engine rushing through rain
and mist. "My business," he once said to Cyrus
Redding, "is to draw what I see: not what I
know is there."</p>

<p>In the years 1845 and 1846, when his sense of
form began to fail, but not his sense of colour, he
re-saw the sea and the sun, to the exclusion of
other aspects of Nature. Of the thirteen pictures
painted in those two years, all but three were of
Venice or of Whalers.</p>

<p>I wish, after our visit to the National Gallery,
I could have taken you to the Old Masters Exhibition,
and there bid you look at his "Mercury
and Hersé," painted in 1811, when he saw with
the eyes of Claude. Pleasant are the blue lakes,
the distances and the veiled horizon, the faint
hills and the arching sky; but they are derivative
as the drawing-master trees and the wooden<span class="pagenum">[Pg 57]</span>
foreground with its score of dummy figures, its
posed Mercury, its unrealised Hersé, and its
architectural litter. When you had absorbed
this "Mercury and Hersé" of 1811, I would have
turned your gaze to the "Burning of the Houses
of Parliament" of 1835, the real Turner, seeing
with his own eyes the fury of burning buildings,
an orgy of flames roaring up to the star-sown
sky. The far end of the stone bridge, a nocturne
in the palest blues and yellows, drops into the
fire, half the sky is aglow, half is a night blue,
and the gold and sapphire are reflected in the
water, where dim boats push out from the shade
into the dazzle, and thousands of figures, mere
suggestions of forms, watch the two towers,
molten silver, standing solitary and self-contained
like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the
flames.</p>

<p>It was such spade-work as the "Liber
Studiorum" that enabled him to triumph in such
an impossible subject as "The Burning of the
Houses of Parliament." Imagine what this
series of drawings meant! Claude's "Liber
Veritatis," to rival which the "Liber Studiorum"
was designed, was a mere record of his pictures.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 58]</span>
Turner's "Liber Studiorum" was a survey of
Nature, classified under six heads,&mdash;architectural,
pastoral, elegant or epic-pastoral, marine,
mountainous, and historical or heroic. These
divisions were suggested by "Dad." "Well,
Gaffer," said Turner, "I see there will be no
peace till I comply; so give me a piece of paper."
He made each drawing in sepia; he etched the
essential lines, and he trained a school of engravers
(not without quarrelling) to engrave
them.</p>

<p>Men have loved the "Liber." Connoisseurs,
like Mr. Rawlinson, have specialised in it. I know
an enthusiast who spends hours in the course of
the year, smoking his pipe, gazing at (a poor
impression, but his own) No. VII., "The Straw
Yard," that hangs on his study-wall against a
reproduction of Girtin's "White House at Chelsea,"
and he wonders which he would save first
if the house caught fire. I have been a quarter
of an hour late for an appointment through returning
twice to a certain house to enjoy again
Mr. Frank Short's engravings of two of the
unpublished drawings&mdash;the "Crowhurst" and
the "Stonehenge." But I never knew what the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 61]</span>
"Liber" really was until I saw Mr. Rawlinson's
collection, the depth and velvety richness of a
very early state of the "Raglan Castle," and the
large and still simplicity of the "Junction of
Severn and Wye." Some day it may be your
privilege to see them; but first we will descend
to the ground floor of the National Gallery and
please ourselves by making a choice among the
seventy and more sepia drawings for the "Liber"
that hang on the wall of the first room.</p>

<p>But I doubt if you will have patience to go
through all, for around, and in little rooms
beyond, are the water-colours.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_V" id="LETTER_V">LETTER V</a><br />
<span class="subheading">THE FLAME LEAPS, EXPANDS, AND EXPIRES</span></h2>


<p>When I think of Turner it is the later
water-colours that flash before me. The
oils are magnificent, tremendous, wrought in
rivalry and for fame: the water-colours, lyrical
impressions, moods of elation inspired by beauty,
are himself. We will go straight to the six
studies that hung on the wall by the fireplace,
essential effects selected with unerring instinct
from the unessential, called "Running Wave in
a Cross-tide: Evening;" "Twilight on the Sea;"
"Sunshine on the Sea on a Stormy Evening;"
"Breaking Wave on Beach;" "Sunset on the
Sea;" and "Coasting Vessels." The very titles
are lyrics. Yet they are not more beautiful than
other interpretations, pushed into the region
where feeling and vision merge into ecstasy&mdash;those
I have already mentioned, and some, my
particular favourites, hanging on the wall to the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 63]</span>
left of Ruskin's bust&mdash;the "Pilatus," the careful
alchemy of "Carnarvon," and the atmospheric
veils that part above the "Lake of Uri." Year
by year other of his water-colours shine out
momentarily at exhibitions, such as at the last
Old Masters, when we saw the blue and gold
"Lake of Thun," and the visionary "Lake of Zug"
about which Ruskin wrote so enthusiastically
in "Modern Painters"; and the "apocalyptic
splendour" of the "Zurich" at Messrs. Agnew's.</p>

<p>But one never reaches the end of his achievement
in the National Gallery collection. A
selection of the four hundred is permanently on
view, but a greater number are stored in cabinets
in an inner room, whence once in three months
an assortment is withdrawn for exhibition. Apart
from these there are the thousands of drawings
and studies disinterred from the tin boxes which
have been arranged chronologically by Mr. A. J.
Finberg, in a hundred vast drawers, preparatory
to his long labour on the <i>Catalogue Raisonné</i>.</p>

<p>Mark their range and you will realise that the
whole world was his province. Think of the
books he illustrated&mdash;the Rivers, Harbours, and
Southern Coast Scenery of England, the Rivers<span class="pagenum">[Pg 64]</span>
of France, to name but four&mdash;travelling often on
foot, with his luggage in a handkerchief tied to
the end of a stick, flushing in the inn at night
transparent washes of colour on paper, flowing
tint into tint, knowing exactly what to do,
sponging, scraping, using knife and finger, anything
to force the material to express his vision.
Once after a Rhine tour he appeared at Farnley
Hall with a roll of fifty-three water-colours,
painted at the rate of three a day.</p>

<p>I must show you the map of England and Scotland
compiled by Mr. Huish, showing Turner's
tours. It is covered with the lines of his tracks;
you may see where he trudged or coached,
and note the fourteen cathedrals, twenty-seven
abbeys, and sixty-six castles which he drew.
Similar maps might be made of France, Italy,
and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Thinking of his wanderings, I look from the
window of one of the Turner water-colour rooms
near to the bust of Ruskin, who arranged and
catalogued them; I look from the window and
see a line of the new, dandy, taximeter cabs, and
plan a little journey through London we two
would take, if you were here. We would visit<span class="pagenum">[Pg 65]</span>
Van Tromp at the Soane, and then drive straight
to the South Kensington Museum, where there
are golden dreams by Turner such as the "Royal
Yacht Squadron, Cowes"; but we would not
tarry with the oils, for I should be impatient
to show you the wall of water-colours, some behind
protecting blinds,&mdash;the early "Wrexham,"
ageing houses and grey-blue tower; the perfect
suggestion of the spirit of place called "Sketch of
an Italian Town," and the fairy-like blue, gold, and
purple "Lake of Brienz," pure flame of Turner.</p>

<p>Then we would speed to Millbank, enter the
Tate Gallery, and stand in Room VII. where the
recovered sunshine Turners hang in radiant
array. Ruskin, you will remember, after Turner's
death, separated the "finished from the unfinished."
The "finished" are in the National
Gallery; the "unfinished" are among the forty-four
at Millbank. Fifty years ago they were deposited,
hidden from public gaze, in the National
Gallery; early in 1905 they were examined by
order of the trustees, cleaned, restored, and
found to be brilliant and fresh, as on the day
when the greatest landscape painter the world
has known, painted them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>These forty-four pictures should be sorted.
Some show but the tumbling splendour of his
decline when he fumbled with his visions, and produced
such chaotic failures as the two Deluges,
the "Burning Fiery Furnace," "The Angel
standing in the Sun," "Undine," and "The
Exile and the Rock Limpet." The holiday
crowd, when I was last at the Tate Gallery,
laughed as their forerunners laughed when the
pictures were first exhibited. Their laughter
enabled me to understand why Turner was
secretive and boorish in old age, when his
imagination outsoared his dwindling power to
express his dreams in paint. Many visitors
giggled and made flippant comments, just as
<i>Punch</i> did when the old lion's eyes began to fail
and his hand to tremble. Had Turner ceased
painting when he was nearing seventy he might
have been spared much, but he could not stop.
His inward eye still saw gorgeous scenes, and
amid the grime of his dingy house in Queen
Anne Street he struggled with such unearthly
themes as this Deluge in the evening and the
morning, and Napoleon in the sunset of his exile.
These are the pictures of his magnificent decline<span class="pagenum">[Pg 67]</span>
at which the crowd laughed, and at that riot
of forms, so glorious in colour, called "Interior
at Petworth." But they did not laugh at the
"<a href="#PLATE_III">Norham Castle, Sunrise</a>," a flush of the prismatic
varieties of light against the blue mists of
dawn, or at "The Evening Star," a nocturne
thrown off long before Whistler popularised the
word, done at the period when, the crepuscular
hour of bats and owls obsessing Turner, he produced
those small moonlight mezzotints, wonderful,
dim, silver things, that were found in his
house after he was dead. They did not laugh at
the "Hastings," delicate blues and golden greys,
with splendour in the upper sky, and the whole
canvas aflame with the orange sail of the boat
drawn up on the beach; or at the Yacht racing,
an impression of sails against a tumbling sea, or
at "<a href="#PLATE_I">A Ship Aground</a>," the ground-swell rolling
by the helpless vessel, and the sun setting angrily
behind a bank of cloud; or at the <a href="#PLATE_VIII">Tivoli</a>, an
imaginative classical landscape probably painted
as a pendant to the "Arch of Constantine."
The setting suggests the scenery of Tivoli; but
when Turner's imagination was fired, he cared
little about topographical accuracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>That day I waited until closing time, loth to
leave these visions, noting with what art he had
piled the chrome on the white ground in "Sunrise,
with a Boat between Headlands," the delicacy
of the faint hues, the gold in the sky, the
gold on the cliff, splashed yonder with blue, and
the golden boat sailing ever on.</p>

<p>The hour drew near five. The attendant
appeared, drew the curtains one by one over the
sunshine pictures, hiding them with red hangings,
all but the four large valedictory scenes
from classical mythology, and the other splendid
failures which have no curtains.</p>

<p>When I left the Gallery and stood upon the
terrace overlooking the Thames and thence
towards Chelsea, I saw, in the mind's eye, the
print published after Turner's death that I had
picked years ago from a twopenny portfolio in
the Brompton Road, showing the little house by
Cremorne Pier where he died, under the assumed
name of Booth. The sun shines upon the building.
The Thames flows in front of it. It is said
that as long as strength held he would rise at daybreak,
and wrapped in a blanket, stand upon the
roof watching the colour flush the eastern sky.</p>

<div class="caption">
<h3>PLATE VIII.&mdash;TIVOLI.</h3>

<p class="small center">(From the oil painting by
Turner in the Tate Gallery)</p>

<p>An imaginative classical landscape probably painted as a pendant
to the "Arch of Constantine, Rome," which also hangs in the
Tate Gallery. It has been suggested that the phantom figures are
Tobit and the Angel. The setting suggests the scenery of Tivoli;
but when Turner's imagination was fired, he cared little about
topographical or historical accuracy.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 71]</span>The Chelsea hiding-place was discovered, but
he was sinking when a friend found him. He
died on December 18, 1851, at the window, looking
upon the river, propped upon his couch. A
full, and, I think, with occasional lapses&mdash;the lot
of all&mdash;a happy life, for his work never ceased
to be less than absorbing. He died in the light,
having run his race to the goal.</p>

<p>The account of that dinner at David Roberts'
house, not long before his death, when he tried
to propose his host's health, "ran short of words
and breath, and dropped down in his chair, with
a hearty laugh, starting again, and finishing with
a 'hip, hip, hurrah!'" shows that the power to enjoy,
and the sense of fun, had not withdrawn from
the solitary genius, the "very moral of a master
carpenter, with lobster red face, large fluffy hat
and enormous umbrella," who wrestled with the
sun, read Ovid, and Young's "Night Thoughts,"
tramped Europe in pursuit of beauty, and who
was seen on the old Margate steamer studying
the movement of the water, and the boiling foam
in the wake of the "Magnet," and making his
luncheon off shrimps strewn over an immense red
handkerchief spread across his knee&mdash;Turner.</p>

<h2><a name="POSTSCRIPT" id="POSTSCRIPT">POSTSCRIPT</a><br />
<span class="subheading">TURNER AND TWO OTHERS</span></h2>


<p>Climbing the stairs to the flat, I passed a
girl who was toiling upwards.</p>

<p>Pressing the button of the electric bell I
watched her ascend the last flight. She paused.
I inferred that our destination was the same,
noted that she carried a satchel, a thick notebook,
and a paper-covered sixpenny reprint.
Mildly curious as to the title of the novel, I
dissembled, and read "Endeavours after the
Christian Life," by James Martineau. Therewith
the stone staircase faded away, the stone walls
opened to the past, and I saw my youth, and the
figure of my father returning one night to the old
home, his face illumined, his eyes shining; heard
again the earnest words between him and my
mother; how he had been at Martineau's valedictory
address, how with the teacher's communication
telling of deep things of the spirit<span class="pagenum">[Pg 73]</span>
moving within him he had avoided friends,
unable to return suddenly to earth, and how he
had walked home as if with wings. Those were
the days when the "Endeavours" was a costly,
exclusive, and somewhat revolutionary book.
A few quick years, and lo! it becomes one of
Allenson's sixpenny series, bought by the hundred
thousand.</p>

<p>The door of the flat opened, Martineau slept
again with his forefathers, the saints of all time,
and the girl and I passed into the modest room
dedicated to one who was no saint. Yet I do not
know. If a saint be he who by his life makes
this world for others more wonderful, more
beautiful and better worth living in, then Joseph
Mallord William Turner was a saint. Which is
strange.</p>

<p>I did not speak of saints to our hostess, for
Turner is her god, and a god is greater than a
half-god. There is one severe note in her room&mdash;the
bust of Cæsar on a pedestal; all the rest is
beauty&mdash;sheer beauty. I wonder what a far-horizon
Colonial, who had never seen Turner's
later water-colours, would feel in this room;
walls covered with sensitive copies of those<span class="pagenum">[Pg 74]</span>
flushes of radiant colour, waning blue dawns,
purple mysteries of eve, sunlighted Swiss lakes,
dream buildings, rainbow reaches of the Rhine,
opalescent distances stretching past headlands
into infinity.</p>

<p>The head of Cæsar, from his tall pedestal,
surveyed these lyrics in colour, as strange to him
as would have been the "Endeavours after the
Christian Life," that paper book, tightly clutched,
hidden from view, in a girl's hand. Then twilight
came, the lamp was lighted, and I went away to
carry out an idea that had just shaped itself.</p>

<p>I had never seen the house in Queen Anne
Street where Turner lived with Mrs. Danby and
the cats. Should I find the house changed&mdash;houses
rather, for he owned three, two in Harley
Street, and one in Queen Anne Street, communicating
mysteriously at the back, and leaving
the corner building in other hands.</p>

<p>As I walked through the Bloomsbury Squares
I thought not of Turner, but of another, a man,
very old, very frail, bent almost double, with the
face of a spirit and the eye of a seer, whom years
ago I had met on this very spot, creeping round
the railings which encircle the grass and trees&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[Pg 75]</span>James
Martineau, still lingering in the world
which his spirit had long outsoared. I saw, in
the mind's eye, that shrivelled octogenarian
figure, and I asked at three shops for the "Endeavours
after the Christian Life," found it in
the fourth, and under lamp-post and by lighted
windows, turned the familiar pages and read
fragments.</p>

<p>The chapter headings stirred old thoughts,
and there was one passage in the discourse on
"Immortality" that seemed the voice of the dead
murmuring as I went westward through the dark
squares, saying that we see here only the partial
operation of a higher law, that we witness no
extinction, but simply migrations of the mind,
which survives to fulfil its high offices elsewhere,
and find perhaps in seeming death its true
nativity.</p>

<p>As I walked that voice stilled the tumult of
the traffic, companioned me through unfamiliar
streets, until I knew by the brass plates on the
doors, and the lighted rooms shining through
holland blinds in upper stories, that I was in
Harley Street, and near to Turner's house.
Which was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>A frock-coated, shining-hatted, prosperous
personage, carrying a small black bag, was inserting
a latch-key in one of the brass plate
doors. As I advanced, his black bag swung up
to cover his watch-chain.</p>

<p>"Which was Turner's house?" said I.</p>

<p>"Turner! What Turner? Was he a medical
man?"</p>

<p>"No! the great Turner, I mean the Painter."</p>

<p>He collected himself, reflected, and said: "Ah!
I do remember something! Yes, there is a tablet
on the house yonder."</p>

<p>I peered up at the dwelling and saw, half
way to the roof, a medallion, and the lamplight
shining upon the first letters of the name Turner.
This was the house of him who interpreted the
feel of Nature, the movement of sea and wind, the
glory of the sun, the mystery of its veiled face,
the pomp of the world, the magic influence of
light so transcendently that we say: "Yes! this
magician was initiate! This queer Englishman
was near to the eternal dream of his Maker."</p>

<p>As I stood in the dark street and looked up
at Turner's house, the Shades gathered about
me. A wizard in words joined this son of a<span class="pagenum">[Pg 77]</span>
London barber, and that saint whose works have
gone into a sixpenny edition.</p>

<p>This was the house that Ruskin knew.
Behind these walls, were stored the pictures
and water-colours in praise of which the most
eloquent, the most inspiring, the most wilful and
bewildering book that has ever been written
upon art, was composed. Book? A library!
The index alone of "Modern Painters" fills one
volume. On the doorstep of this house Turner
once stood and said to his disciple, who was
about to start forth on a foreign tour&mdash;"Don't
make your parents anxious. They'll be in such
a fidge about you." He did not understand
literary enthusiasm, and I doubt if he ever read
a page of the copy of "The Stones of Venice"
that Ruskin presented to him.</p>

<p>Three ghosts in a walk through London!
Three great figures that trailed through the
nineteenth century&mdash;a wizard in paint, a wizard
in words, a wizard in holiness. Which is the
greatest? Ruskin and Martineau explained,
taught, chided, interpreted, and uplifted. Turner
just acted, was content merely to express himself,
to state his wonder at the wonder of the world.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 78]</span>
Is not his influence the most enduring? A man
of few words and those mostly incoherent, who
taught nothing, believed nothing, gazed on the
sun with hope, and did superhuman things. His
prayers were his pictures.</p>
